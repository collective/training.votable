Votable Behavior
----------------

`training.votable` is part of the training story of 'Mastering Plone Development' on https://training.plone.org/.
The training story takes the use case of selecting talk and training submissions for a conference.

`training.votable` adds the feature for registered users to vote for talks and trainings.
It started as a Plone Classic add-on and is still valuable for Plone Classic with its viewlet for voting and reviewing.

The add-on evolved to a Plone REST API provider for the **Mastering Plone Development** roundtrip story on how to join backend and frontend if Plone REST API does not fit your needs, because you need more elaborated info from your backend.

The counter part on frontend side is https://github.com/collective/volto-training-votable.
It provides the code for voting components for a Volto app.
