Mastering Plone Development training â€“ backend add-on for the votable behavior

`training.votable` provides the code for the voting behavior and REST services.
It is the counter part of the Plone frontend add-on [`volto-training-votable` ](https://github.com/collective/volto-training-votable) which provides the components and actions for voting on arbitrary content type instances by authenticated users.

`volto-training-votable` and `training.votable` are part of the training story of 'Mastering Plone Development' on [training.plone.org/mastering-plone](https://training.plone.org/mastering-plone/voting-story).
